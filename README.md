# SuperMarioFPGA
This is a Super Mario hardware implementation using VHDL. 
The project was developed for an Altera Cyclone II DE1 board using Altera Quartus II Web Edition.

Before to run the code on Altera DE1 You need to write on FLASH memory the SuperMarioBros16PCM.wav file using the offical Control panel for Altera DE1 board.
